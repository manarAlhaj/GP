# Talk to the hand: a Real-Time Sign Language Recognition Glove with Audible Speech Output 
an embedded based glove which is a real-time sign language recognition glove that translates gestures into audible speech output. 
The system integrates multiple hardware components, including flex sensors, an IMU, an ADC, and a Raspberry Pi, working together to capture, process, and convert hand gestures 
into spoken language using a pretrained AI model.
